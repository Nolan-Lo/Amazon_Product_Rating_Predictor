# Amazon Product Rating Predictor
### 1.  Finish Major Preprocessing

The dataset we chose for our analysis was well cleaned and highly processed.  However, given the size of the entire dataset, which includes ~300 million review observations, training dataset is partitioned before model runs to leverage parallel processing.  Given the limitations and computational cost needed to train on the entire dataset, we sub-sampled our dataset to begin our model testing process.

### 2.  First Model Train
Our primary model was built based on a random forest model design.
