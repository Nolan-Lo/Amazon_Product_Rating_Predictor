# Amazon_Product_Rating_Predictor
This project leverages Amazon product reviews and item metadata to predict customer star ratings by applying sentiment analysis and structured data modeling. Beyond prediction, our goal is to uncover why certain products receive the reviews they do, and to identify patterns that vary across categories, price points, and product types.
